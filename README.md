# v5-reports-public

This repository contains **sanitized** artifacts exported from `v5-trading-bot` to track small-live progress.

Included:
- `reports/runs/**/summary.json`
- `reports/cost_stats/daily_cost_stats_*.json`
- `reports/walk_forward.json`

Excluded by default (sensitive):
- any `*.sqlite` (fills/bills/orders)
- `reconcile_status.json` / balance snapshots
- per-trade `trades.csv`

All timestamps are generated by the bot; this repo is meant for transparency/debugging, not for account replication.
